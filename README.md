# Week 3 CSS Projects

This repository contains two projects focused on learning and practicing CSS concepts:

## 1. 5.4 Color Vocab Project
- Practice using colors in CSS.
- Features multiple colored boxes representing different color names.
- Organized with separate HTML and CSS files.
- Includes a reference image (`goal.png`) and a solution folder for comparison.

## 2. 6.3 CSS Box Model
- Demonstrates the CSS Box Model using three boxes with different borders, paddings, and margins.
- Each box is styled to illustrate how the box model works in practice.
- All styles are written directly in the `index.html` file.
- Includes a reference image (`goal.png`) and a solution file for comparison.

## How to View
Open the `index.html` file in each project folder in your browser to see the result. Compare with the provided `goal.png` for the expected layout.

## Project Structure
- Each project is in its own folder:
  - `5.4 Color Vocab Project/`
  - `6.3 CSS Box Model/`
- Each folder contains:
  - `index.html`: Main file for the project
  - `goal.png`: Reference image for the final layout
  - `solution.html` or `solution/`: Example solution for comparison
  - (Color Vocab Project only) `style.css` and `assets/images/`
